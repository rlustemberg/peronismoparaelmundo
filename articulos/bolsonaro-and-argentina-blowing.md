## Bolsonaro and Argentina: blowing hot and cold.


Brazil inaugurated, along with the current year, the government cycle of Jair Bolsonaro. He is the emerging surprise of the systemic crisis of the traditional political scaffolding.

Since the change in the system of representations is so significant, it is worthwhile to delve into the possible derivations that could result. This is especially relevant after the initial steps of the new administration confirmed our assessments  that "there is a clear contradiction between the nationalist discourse and the neoliberal program of the appointed minister Paulo Guedes, which framed within the decadent paradigm of the Washington Consensus (WC) , it is against the emerging models of national development and the new guidelines that begin to govern relations between nations."

It is then inevitable that the deterioration of political institutions in Brazil tends to remain and increase.  This will happen as a result of the predominance of "globalism" assumed in economic and foreign policy, above the expected defense of domestic interests promised by his campaign speech, even though, among the different aspects of the heterogeneous field of nationalism, the new government will be among those that propose the "construction of walls", distant from those that aspire to "build bridges".
Therefore, the present crisis will not only not be solved, but it is also possible to expect for its deepening and even its extension towards Brazil's own social and economic configuration, whose repercussions, in terms of international relations, will be substantive for Argentina.

#### Failure there, opportunity here

As it happened with the current Argentine government, the assumption of Bolsonaro awakened the adhesion of some business segments.
But, given that both the Foreign Ministry and the economic portfolio have ratified their enthusiastic embrace of the now obsolete rules of globalization, and that the objections to free trade outlined during the campaign have faded since the electoral triumph, the resulting poor economic performance will be responsible for vanishing the hopes, as it happened in Argentina.
It is the design itself that allows to anticipate serious consequences in the economic functioning, which is oriented to privilege the rate of profit in the primary sector, to the detriment of the-until now-powerful industrial framework, which will be subjected to unequal competition with its foreign pairs.

This opens a scenario that, as we anticipated in November in (["Sobre las representaciones y lo representado: los casos de Brasil y de Argentina"](https://www.baenegocios.com/economia-finanzas/Sobre-las-representaciones-y-lo-representado-los-casos-de-%20%20%3Ca%20href='/tags/Brasil'%3EBrasil%3C/a%3E-y-de-%20%20%3Ca%20href='/tags/Argentina'%3EArgentina%3C/a%3E--20181104-0008.html), BAE, 5/11/18, in Spanish), is expected to be marked by instability, since:

*"the coup d'état that overthrew João Goulart, managed to configure a model of accumulation that gave viability to the association of the old oligarchies with a significant part of the emerging upper and middle layers. This meant, in turn, the partition of the lattice that gave sustenance to the experience of that Brazilian nationalism, until the final fading out of that tradition, so that the excluded social segments, numerous indeed, deprived of their natural alliances, lacked sufficient volume to engender relevant or central political representations.
It is from there, that a process is developed in which the logical tensions and adaptations to changing scenarios, are given without questioning the central features of the national economic structure, determining, at the same time, the remarkable stability of the Brazilian political system, which is evolving towards the postulates of the Washington Consensus, through different versions and combinatorics of its two iconic expressions (social democracy and neoliberalism), even with the incorporation of new figures and relevant formations. "*

This association has reached its limits, giving rise to the current crisis of representativeness, which, due to the inevitable collision of interests that will occur between winners and losers of the "Bolsonaro model", will be further deepened.
Hence, as we also pointed out last year, the question remains, towards the medium term, *"about whether Bolsonaro will not be, the last intermediate step towards the genesis of a new political superstructure that, finally, puts into question the pattern of accumulation on which the order that today is in question was sustained ".*

In all cases, it is clear that the path chosen by Brazil represents an opportunity for the productive fabric of our country, by connecting with the need to modify relations, taking into account that these are economies that are not complementary to each other, but essentially competitive
We said in ["The new New World"](https://www.baenegocios.com/economia-finanzas/El-nuevo-Nuevo-Mundo-20181021-0026.html) (BAE, 10/22/18, in Spanish): "the design of the new cycle of economic integration, adapted to the needs of our development model, will require, in addition to redefining the relationship with Brazil, extending the horizons of the commercial exchange in a scheme of articulation in which the Argentine production arrives, among other destinies, more and more to the north of the continent.
In the new dawn of the Homeland, our best future will be to know how to integrate all the Spanish-speaking nations of South America, in a harmonious set of complementary economies, around the axis Caracas-Bogotá-Lima-Buenos Aires, thus recovering the [San Martinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_de_San_Mart%C3%ADn#Guayaquil_conference)  feat. "
If to the divorce caused by the overlap of our conveniences with the Brazilian foreign policy determinations, we add the expected weakening of its manufacturing segments, we have an opportunity, possibly unique in history, for the industrial development of Argentina, provided that its protagonists, workers and entrepreneurs, are able to give political materiality with the rest of the actors.

#### Who are the "enemies" of Brazil?

The sure internal disenchantment with the economic performance of Brazil in the times to come, predicts a greater social and political conflict, which is expected to be answered, doubling down, with higher levels of deployment of repressive forces and flaring of discourse of intolerance.

This could configure a new scenario for our country, in terms of defense and national security.
It is possible that pointing and fighting "internal enemies" (for example, by characterizing drug trafficking as terrorism) will not be enough to reduce the damage that economic failure will produce in the relationship between representatives and their representatives. Hypotheses of "external threats" could return to be the order of the day, as well as our country in the sights of Brazilian weapons.
It would be quite consistent with the worldview of its current government, to strengthen the extensive hegemonic tradition that has characterized Brazil, and not only invigorating its arms policy, but also promoting tensions with its neighbors, in order to help the decompression of the internal situation .
Hence, as a urgent necessity, the need to redefine  the priorities regarding our armed forces and the of custody of our borders with Brazil.
As we have repeatedly argued, the "third world war in installments," as Pope Francis characterizes it, is a battle for the protection of work and employment, in which the axioms of the "economic" and "defense and national security" disciplines  ", are overlapping to give foundation to the political decisions that typify the current process of consolidation of the New International Order.
That is how it should be for our country, if we want to take advantage of the window of opportunity that opens before the decline of globalization and the wrong decision of Brazil to accompany it to its last death rattles.
